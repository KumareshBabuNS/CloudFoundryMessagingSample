Demo application for Rabbit and Cloud Foundry

To run the application:
- Compile it using
mvn package
- Sign up for a Cloud Foundry account at http://cloudfoundry.com
- Install vmc as described at http://start.cloudfoundry.com/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html
- Change to the target directory
- Install the application using
vmc push
- A Java Spring application should be autodetected - this is fine.
- Make sure to bind a RabbitMQ service to the application.
- You can access the application at the URL defined during deployment.
- You can just send messages and receive them again.
